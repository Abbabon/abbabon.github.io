Introduce external dlls

Possible issues

Code Example and git repo

when should we use dlls? 

good question! I can't think of additional good scenarios, except when using c++ or c interops.
However, considering Unity's integrated tools like the package manager for sharing and versioning Unity-specific code and assets, and assembly definitions for reducing compilation times, using DLLs may not be as compelling in a Unity-only context.

As always, the choice between using DLLs or Unity's built-in features will depend on your project's specific requirements and constraints.

Well, it's been abandoned here on the blog for a while. More than a year. While I don't want to set expectations too high - I intend to continue posting here more frequently moving forward. 

I wanted to do many things here - setting up a portfolio, writing micro-entries and making the site more responsive. But investigating into that made me abandon the original goal of this blog - creating quality content
