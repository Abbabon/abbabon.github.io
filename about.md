Look, this being the internet and all, I will try to be low with the bio and succinct with the flavour.

Assuming you've clicked on About you have some questions! So, here are some answers:

* Hi! I'm Amit, a professional game developer and software engineer from Israel.

* I am interested in challenges like creating tools for level design, shader programming, 3d software rendering, procedural generation, mobile games performance optimization, [constraint-based-game-programming](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), and AI systems.

* I am programming-language / ecosystem agnostic. I've programmed web-scraping bots in Python, games in Unity, fullstack projects in Angular/Ruby-on-Rails, photo processing in Matlab. I've seen some s$#@!

* I currently own 7 mechanical keyboards. I wonder if my 1986 Model M qualifies; if it does then I own 8.
	
* In my limited spare time I learn Japanese (via a wicked combination of [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/abbabon), [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com/users/abbabon), [KaniWani](https://kaniwani.com/), [Anki Flashcards of Genki I && II](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/942922371) and [Tandem](https://www.tandem.net/)). しかし、私はまだ上手していません.

* Mezookan is Hebrew for 'bearded'. My strength stems from my beard.
