Look, this being the internet and all, I will try to be low with the bio and succinct with the flavour.

Assuming you've clicked on About you have some questions! So, here are some answers:

* Hi! I'm Amit, a professional game developer and software engineer from Israel.

* Tehnology-wise, I am interested in challenges like creating tools for level design, shader programming, procedural generation, shaders, mobile games performance and AI systems.

* I am programming-language / ecosystem agnostic. I've programmed web-scraping bots in Python, games in Unity, fullstack projects in Angular/Ruby-on-Rails, photo processing in Matlab. I've seen some s$#@!

* Game-Genre-wise, I am interested in 4X, Tactics, Grand Strategy, Narrative Adventure, Souls-like, RPGs (cRPG, jRPG, tabletop, OSR), Roguelikes, Rougelites, Rhythm Games, Board Games, and even have my VR phases from time to time.

* I currently own 7 mechanical keyboards. I wonder if my 1986 Model M qualifies; if it does then I own 8.

* Mezookan is Hebrew for 'bearded'. My strength stems from my beard.

Even more questions?
