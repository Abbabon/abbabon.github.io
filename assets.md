These are (some) of the assets I use when I make games with Unity. They are categorized freeformly by I how I see them.

When I will finish my post about assets (based on a talk I gave at [MakeGamesJLM](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zdq6JJvbFkyDCvGvLpMfDTs95D2WDT1-FR3L0Xy_gXI/edit?usp=sharing)), I will also link it here and add some information about each asset and why it's worth your money. But for now, just know that an asset marked with :pizza: means that it's great for game jams!

A short disclaimer - the asset store links are affiliated links. If you end up buying the asset through them you pay the same, but I a percentage of that... Which I can re-invest in other Unity Assets! And cover them for this blog. A good deal all around.

## Unity Packages

These can be installed using the Unity Package Manager and are worth their weight in gold. Well, they are just a few megs each.

## Programming Libraries

These are packages that can help you program a bit smarter or faster. Or cleaner. We love SOLID programming here!

[Extenject](https://bit.ly/33YktNy)

[RSG Promises](https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games/C-Sharp-Promise)

## Time-Savers

These are systems you really don't want to re-create for every game. At least while prototyping. Things like controllers, save system, etc..

[LeanTouch+](https://bit.ly/371OHBf)

[EasySave](https://bit.ly/33Z0Dl9)

[In-Control](https://bit.ly/3oH0SJt)

## Shaders

[All-in-1-shader](https://bit.ly/376fT1T) :pizza:

## Asset Packs

These packs contain many assets that are either great for beginners, programmers or just 'lazy devs'. They are also have to be versatile, extendable, and easy to use to get here.

[Epic Toon FX](https://bit.ly/36YYjN5) :pizza:

## Systems

These are whole gameplay systems that are worth looking into if you are not interested in writing an entire engine for a prototype or even a small game.

[Dialogue System](https://bit.ly/3n1TuYN) + [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/)

[Master Audio](https://bit.ly/3r1P8Uf)

## Novel Abilities

These assets do either something special, that is either hard to reproduce, or just doesn't worth the time for most people to try to.
